## What to bring

- Masks. Police may fine you if you don‚Äôt wear mask in public transport
- Bring rain jacket and warm clothes. It gets cold, rainy and windy in Autumn
- Most places accept credit/debit card so almost cash is not needed. I recommend to use [Wise](https://wise.com/?clickref=1011lixId9A4&partnerID=1100l232059&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=1101l60648&adref=&utm_source=amnpoosri&partnerizecampaignID=1011l727) for exchanging to PLN and order Wise card for traveling. They have the cheapest exchange rate
